\description{
Returns the similarity between two quantitative variables, two qualitative
variables or a quantitative variable and a qualitative variable.  The
similarity between two variables is defined as a square cosine: the square
of the Pearson correlation when the two variables are quantitative; the
correlation ratio when one variable is quantitative and the other one is
qualitative; the square of the canonical correlation between two sets of
dummy variables, when the two variables are qualitative.
